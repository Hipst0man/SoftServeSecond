Сlass that can store single values of C++ fundamental type (except void and std::nullptr_t) and a function/method performs type-safe access to the conteined value.
Acceptance Criteria:<br />
    • The class should contain all type of constructors<br />
    • The class should contain all type of assignment operators<br />
    • The class should contain a method to destroy contained object<br />
    • The class should contain a method to swap two objects<br />
    • The class should contain a method returns the type of the contained value<br />
    • The function/method that extracts a value should provide type-safe access. If the requested type does not match to stored type exception should be thrown
